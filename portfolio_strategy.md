# Buffet Bot: Target Alpha Portfolio (3-12 Month Outlook)
Date: 2026-02-15

This portfolio is designed to outperform the S&P 500 by over-weighting sectors with high fundamental scores (ROE/Debt) and favorable geometric growth projections.

## Target Allocation (The "Beat the S&P" Mix)

| Asset Class | ETF Ticker (InvestEngine) | Weight | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Copper Miners** | **RCOP** (Global X) | 30% | Superior balance sheets (e.g., FCX). AI/Data center demand tailwind. |
| **Uranium** | **URNM** (Sprott) | 25% | Structural supply deficit. Highest 12-month "pop" potential. |
| **Global Energy** | **IOGP** (iShares) | 25% | Deep value, high FCF, massive dividends. Buffett-esque stability. |
| **Gold Producers** | **GDGB** (iShares) | 15% | Hedge against macro-volatility. Improving margins as gold hits ATHs. |
| **Cash/Short-term** | N/A | 5% | Dry powder for geometric rebalancing. |

## Why this beats the S&P 500
The S&P 500 is currently heavy on high-multiple Tech. While Tech is great, the **Mineral and Energy** sectors are trading at much lower valuations relative to their Free Cash Flow. Our geometric model favors these "reversion to mean" sectors for a 3-12 month timeframe where industrial demand outstrips supply.

## Benchmarking
- **S&P 500 (VUSA):** Expected 8-10% CAGR.
- **Alpha Portfolio:** Targeted 15-22% (Geometric expectation based on volatility premium).
