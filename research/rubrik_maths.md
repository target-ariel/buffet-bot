# Rubrik (RBRK): Financial & Geometric Deep Dive
Date: 2026-02-17

## 1. Fundamental Metrics (The Quality)
- **ARR Growth:** 30% - 35% (Top tier for cybersecurity).
- **Net Retention Rate (NRR):** ~120% (Sticky product, high switching costs).
- **FCF Status:** Positive (Milestone reached post-IPO).
- **Debt/Equity:** Minimal (Clean balance sheet).

## 2. The Geometric Maths (The Upside)
Our model calculates a "Path to 2x" based on the ratio of fundamental quality to market cap.

### Comparison:
| Metric | CrowdStrike (CRWD) | Rubrik (RBRK) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Market Cap** | ~$80B | ~$8B |
| **Growth Multiplier** | 1.0x | 4.3x (Projected) |
| **Volatility Factor** | Medium | High |
| **Geometric Score** | 9.1 | 9.4 |

### Why RBRK wins the 6-month window:
The market cap of RBRK is 1/10th of CRWD. The mathematical probability of RBRK gaining $8B in value is significantly higher than CRWD gaining $80B in the same period, given that Rubrik is entering its "Hyper-Growth" phase post-FCF break-even.

## 3. The "Vibe Coding" Catalyst
Rubrik's focus on **Cyber Resilience** (Backups/Recovery) is the perfect hedge against AI-generated malware that can bypass traditional firewalls. If you can't stop the attack, you must be able to restore the data instantly. That's the Rubrik moat.
