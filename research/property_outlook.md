# Property Simulation: West Midlands (2026-2031)

## Core Data Points
- **Current Deficit:** ~15,000 homes/year in WM area.
- **Population Growth:** Projected +4.5% over 5 years.
- **Transport Catalyst:** HS2 Curzon Street completion (partial) and WM Metro expansion.

## Simulation: Political Impact on House Prices

### 1. Market-Led (Conservative Style)
- **Focus:** Demand-side subsidies.
- **Outcome:** Price inflation. 
- **5-Year Growth:** ~18%.

### 2. Supply-Led (Labour Style)
- **Focus:** Planning reform & Grey Belt.
- **Outcome:** Volume increase, price stabilization.
- **5-Year Growth:** ~12%.

### 3. Economic Gridlock
- **Focus:** Infrastructure delays.
- **Outcome:** Stagnation in commuter towns (e.g., Rugby, Leamington).
- **5-Year Growth:** ~4%.

## The "Doubling" Simulation: Asset Inflation vs. Real Value

### Scenario: The Asset Bubble (Inequality Max)
- **Likelihood:** Low (5%)
- **Driver:** Extreme monetary easing + Institutional "Buy-to-Rent" monopoly.
- **Outcome:** Prices double, but the social contract breaks.
- **Verdict:** This is a "wealth protection" scenario, not a "wealth creation" one. If this happens, the pound is likely failing.

## Weighted Probability Table (5-Year Horizon)

| Scenario | Weight | Impact (WM Prices) | Logic |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Organic Baseline** | 65% | +20-25% | Simple supply/demand. |
| **AI Capital Concentration** | 20% | +50-70% | High-productivity wealth fleeing to hard assets. |
| **Monetary Collapse** | 10% | +100%+ | UBI / Hyper-printing devalues the Pound. |
| **Systemic Crash** | 5% | -20% | Interest rate shock / Credit crunch. |

**Strategic Pivot:** If weighting for the 20% "AI Wealth" scenario, target Solihull or the "Silicon Spa" (Leamington) corridor. These areas act as a magnet for concentrated capital.
