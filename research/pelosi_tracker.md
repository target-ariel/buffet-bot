# Pelosi Watch: High-Leverage Tech Tracker
Date: 2026-02-15

Tracking the "Political Alpha" from congressional filings (primarily Paul/Nancy Pelosi) to cross-reference with our Buffett-style mineral strategy.

## 1. Palo Alto Networks (PANW) - Cybersecurity
- **Strategy:** Deep-in-the-money LEAPS (Long-term options).
- **Status:** Post-earnings dip (Feb 2026). Billing guidance shifted, but platform growth remains solid.
- **The Thesis:** This is a "Buy the Dip" moment. The long-term "platformization" moat is intact. Pelosi's LEAPS are positioned for the recovery.

## 2. Microsoft (MSFT) - Enterprise AI
- **Strategy:** Consistent accumulation of deep-in-the-money calls.
- **Status:** Large-cap stability.
- **The Thesis:** Pelosi is betting on the monetization of AI through the existing Office 365 ecosystem. This is the "safe" way to play AI compared to speculative startups.

## 3. NVIDIA (NVDA) - Compute Monopoly
- **Strategy:** Exercising options and holding long-term.
- **Status:** High valuation, but she remains positioned.
- **The Thesis:** Until a viable competitor to CUDA emerges, she is treating NVDA as the "Standard Oil" of the 21st century.

## Strategic Synthesis
If the "Buffet Bot" mineral strategy (Copper/Uranium) provides the **Physical Floor**, the "Pelosi Watch" stocks provide the **Digital Ceiling**. 

**Actionable for Mitch:**
For a diversified "Alpha" approach on Trading 212, consider allocating a 10-15% "Tactical" sleeve to **PANW**. It aligns with our 3-12 month horizon and benefits from the same geopolitical volatility that drives Gold and Uranium.
