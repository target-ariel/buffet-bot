### Strategy Insight
The nuclear sector is currently in a supply-deficit cycle. While Buffett usually avoids pure commodity plays, his "Value" principle applies here to **Kazatomprom** due to its unmatched cost advantage (the 'Moat' of being the lowest-cost producer). 

**Geometric Projection (3-12 Month):**
Given current supply constraints and the 2025/2026 production restarts, URNM shows a geometric bias toward a 20-30% appreciation if spot prices stabilize above $95/lb.

### InvestEngine Action
- **Ticker:** URNM
